# Ralph

![Ralph](ralph.webp)

Ralph is an autonomous AI agent loop that runs AI coding tool [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)) repeatedly until all PRD items are complete. Each iteration is a fresh instance with clean context. Memory persists via git history, `progress.txt`, and `prd.json`.

Based on [Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/).

## Critical Concepts

### Each Iteration = Fresh Context

Each iteration spawns a **new AI instance** (Amp or Claude Code) with clean context. The only memory between iterations is:

- Git history (commits from previous iterations)
- `progress.txt` (learnings and context)
- `prd.json` (which stories are done)

### Small Tasks

Each PRD item should be small enough to complete in one context window. If a task is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces poor code.

Right-sized stories:

- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

Too big (split these):

- "Build the entire dashboard"
- "Add authentication"
- "Refactor the API"

### AGENTS.md Updates Are Critical

After each iteration, Ralph updates the relevant `AGENTS.md` files with learnings. This is key because AI coding tools automatically read these files, so future iterations (and future human developers) benefit from discovered patterns, gotchas, and conventions.

Examples of what to add to AGENTS.md:

- Patterns discovered ("this codebase uses X for Y")
- Gotchas ("do not forget to update Z when changing W")
- Useful context ("the settings panel is in component X")

### Feedback Loops

Ralph only works if there are feedback loops:

- Typecheck catches type errors
- Tests verify behavior
- CI must stay green (broken code compounds across iterations)

### Browser Verification for UI Stories

Frontend stories must include "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" in acceptance criteria. Ralph will use the dev-browser skill to navigate to the page, interact with the UI, and confirm changes work.

### Stop Condition

When all stories have `passes: true`, Ralph outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` and the loop exits.

## Debugging

Check current state:

```bash
# See which stories are done
cat prd.json | jq '.userStories[] | {id, title, passes}'

# See learnings from previous iterations
cat progress.txt

# Check git history
git log --oneline -10
```
