## Issue #72 - Precommit hooks with Husky and Prettier
- Configured Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for automatic code formatting and validation
- Implementation details:
  - Created .prettierrc configuration (2 spaces, semicolons, standard settings)
  - Created .prettierignore to exclude build outputs and dependencies
  - Created .lintstagedrc to run prettier, typecheck, and tests on staged files
  - Added prettier, husky, and lint-staged to devDependencies in package.json
  - Added npm scripts: format, format:check, and prepare (for husky)
  - Created .husky/pre-commit hook to run lint-staged
  - Made pre-commit hook executable
- Pre-commit hook behavior:
  - Automatically formats all staged files with Prettier
  - Runs TypeScript type checking on staged files
  - Runs tests on staged files
  - Provides immediate feedback to LLMs and developers
- Key decisions:
  - Used standard Prettier configuration for consistency
  - Configured lint-staged to run both typecheck and tests for maximum safety
  - No CI workflow exists yet, so format:check not added to CI
  - User must run `pnpm install` to complete setup (permission issue prevents automated install)
- Files changed:
  - .prettierrc (new file)
  - .prettierignore (new file)
  - .lintstagedrc (new file)
  - .husky/pre-commit (new file)
  - package.json (added scripts and devDependencies)
  - SETUP_PRECOMMIT.md (new file with setup instructions)
- Blockers:
  - User needs to resolve pnpm permission issue and run `pnpm install`
  - User should run `npm run format` to format entire codebase before first commit
