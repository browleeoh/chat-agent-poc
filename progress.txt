## Issue #44 - Sticky clip section headers in video editor
- Added CSS sticky positioning to ClipSectionDivider component
- When scrolling through the timeline, the current section header now sticks to the top of the viewport
- Implementation: Added `sticky top-0 z-10 bg-gray-900` classes to ClipSectionDivider button
- Background color ensures section header obscures content scrolling underneath
- z-index ensures section header stays on top of clips
- Key decision: Used native CSS sticky positioning rather than JavaScript scroll listeners for better performance
- All tests pass (21 passed, 1 todo)
- TypeScript typechecks pass
- File changed: app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx:1465

## Issue #47 - Selective section inclusion in Write Article page
- Added ability to selectively include/exclude clip sections in AI prompts
- Write page now shows section checkboxes (only visible when video has clip sections)
- Each section checkbox shows word count for that section
- Main transcript toggle still works - can turn entire transcript off/on
- Implementation details:
  - Loader calculates word count per section while building transcript
  - Added `sectionsWithWordCount` array with id, name, order, and wordCount
  - Added `enabledSections` state (Set<string>) - defaults to all sections enabled
  - Added ScrollArea with section checkboxes showing name and word count
  - Updated completions endpoint schema to accept `enabledSections: string[]`
  - Updated `acquireTextWritingContext` to accept and filter by `enabledSections`
  - Transcript building now filters clips based on enabled sections
  - Maintains section headers (H2) for enabled sections only
- Key decisions:
  - Used same ASCII ordering logic as video editor for consistency
  - Clips before first section are included if no sections exist or all enabled
  - Section filtering works independently from file selection
  - Word counts calculated in loader to avoid recalculation on every render
- All tests pass (21 passed, 1 todo)
- TypeScript typechecks pass
- Files changed:
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx (loader, UI, state, handler)
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.completions.ts (schema, action)
  - app/services/text-writing-agent.ts (acquireTextWritingContext signature and logic)
