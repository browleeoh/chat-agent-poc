## Issue #111: Course Planner prototype (tracer bullet)

**Task completed**: Implemented core localStorage-based course planner with sections and lessons

**Key decisions**:
- Used `fractional-indexing` library for ordering (already installed)
- Created `Plan`, `Section`, `Lesson` types with id, title, order fields
- Lessons have a `notes` field for storing lesson notes
- Plans stored in localStorage under "course-plans" key
- SSR-safe localStorage access with `typeof localStorage !== "undefined"` checks
- Plan detail page allows inline editing of plan title, sections, and lessons
- Lesson detail page has auto-saving notes textarea (500ms debounce)

**Files changed**:
- app/features/course-planner/types.ts - New types for Plan, Section, Lesson
- app/hooks/use-plans.ts - New hook for localStorage CRUD operations
- app/components/create-plan-modal.tsx - Modal for creating new plans
- app/components/app-sidebar.tsx - Added Plans collapsible group with context menu delete
- app/routes/plans.$planId.tsx - Plan detail page with section/lesson management
- app/routes/plans.$planId.lessons.$lessonId.tsx - Lesson detail page with notes textarea

**Blockers**: None

**Remaining work for Issue #111**:
- Drag-and-drop reordering for sections and lessons (requires @dnd-kit integration)
- Plan rename via context menu in sidebar
