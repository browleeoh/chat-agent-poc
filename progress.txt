## Issue #44 - Sticky clip section headers in video editor
- Added CSS sticky positioning to ClipSectionDivider component
- When scrolling through the timeline, the current section header now sticks to the top of the viewport
- Implementation: Added `sticky top-0 z-10 bg-gray-900` classes to ClipSectionDivider button
- Background color ensures section header obscures content scrolling underneath
- z-index ensures section header stays on top of clips
- Key decision: Used native CSS sticky positioning rather than JavaScript scroll listeners for better performance
- All tests pass (21 passed, 1 todo)
- TypeScript typechecks pass
- File changed: app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx:1465

## Issue #47 - Selective section inclusion in Write Article page
- Added ability to selectively include/exclude clip sections in AI prompts
- Write page now shows section checkboxes (only visible when video has clip sections)
- Each section checkbox shows word count for that section
- Main transcript toggle still works - can turn entire transcript off/on
- Implementation details:
  - Loader calculates word count per section while building transcript
  - Added `sectionsWithWordCount` array with id, name, order, and wordCount
  - Added `enabledSections` state (Set<string>) - defaults to all sections enabled
  - Added ScrollArea with section checkboxes showing name and word count
  - Updated completions endpoint schema to accept `enabledSections: string[]`
  - Updated `acquireTextWritingContext` to accept and filter by `enabledSections`
  - Transcript building now filters clips based on enabled sections
  - Maintains section headers (H2) for enabled sections only
- Key decisions:
  - Used same ASCII ordering logic as video editor for consistency
  - Clips before first section are included if no sections exist or all enabled
  - Section filtering works independently from file selection
  - Word counts calculated in loader to avoid recalculation on every render
- All tests pass (21 passed, 1 todo)
- TypeScript typechecks pass
- Files changed:
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx (loader, UI, state, handler)
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.completions.ts (schema, action)
  - app/services/text-writing-agent.ts (acquireTextWritingContext signature and logic)

## Issue #48 - Fixed section checkboxes overflowing into file tree
- Fixed visual bug where section checkboxes were overlapping with files in context
- Changed ScrollArea from `max-h-48` to fixed `h-48` height
- Wrapped ScrollArea in container with `shrink-0` to prevent height collapse
- Key decisions:
  - Fixed height ensures consistent layout and prevents overflow
  - shrink-0 prevents flex container from collapsing the section area
- All tests pass (21 passed, 1 todo)
- TypeScript typechecks pass
- File changed: app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx:501-502

## Issue #49 - Transcript checkbox controls section checkboxes
- Implemented parent-child checkbox relationship between transcript and sections
- Transcript checkbox now shows indeterminate state when some sections selected
- Clicking transcript checkbox toggles all section checkboxes
- Implementation details:
  - Transcript checkbox state derived from enabledSections count when sections exist
  - Shows true when all sections enabled, indeterminate when some enabled, false when none
  - Clicking transcript checkbox sets/clears all sections at once
  - Section checkboxes indented with pl-6 to show parent-child relationship visually
  - Submit handler derives includeTranscript from enabledSections when sections exist
- Key decisions:
  - Matches FileTree behavior for nested folder checkboxes (indeterminate state)
  - Maintains backward compatibility for videos without sections (uses includeTranscript state)
  - Visual indentation makes hierarchy clear to users
- All tests pass (21 passed, 1 todo)
- TypeScript typechecks pass
- File changed: app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx:483-553
