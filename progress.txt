## Issue #72 - Precommit hooks with Husky and Prettier
- Configured Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for automatic code formatting and validation
- Implementation details:
  - Created .prettierrc configuration (2 spaces, semicolons, standard settings)
  - Created .prettierignore to exclude build outputs and dependencies
  - Created .lintstagedrc to run prettier, typecheck, and tests on staged files
  - Added prettier, husky, and lint-staged to devDependencies in package.json
  - Added npm scripts: format, format:check, and prepare (for husky)
  - Created .husky/pre-commit hook to run lint-staged
  - Made pre-commit hook executable
- Pre-commit hook behavior:
  - Automatically formats all staged files with Prettier
  - Runs TypeScript type checking on staged files
  - Runs tests on staged files
  - Provides immediate feedback to LLMs and developers
- Key decisions:
  - Used standard Prettier configuration for consistency
  - Configured lint-staged to run both typecheck and tests for maximum safety
  - No CI workflow exists yet, so format:check not added to CI
  - User must run `pnpm install` to complete setup (permission issue prevents automated install)
- Files changed:
  - .prettierrc (new file)
  - .prettierignore (new file)
  - .lintstagedrc (new file)
  - .husky/pre-commit (new file)
  - package.json (added scripts and devDependencies)
  - SETUP_PRECOMMIT.md (new file with setup instructions)
- Blockers:
  - User needs to resolve pnpm permission issue and run `pnpm install`
  - User should run `npm run format` to format entire codebase before first commit



## Issue #74 - Video Editor Context Refactor with use-context-selector
- Implemented use-context-selector to eliminate prop drilling and improve performance
- Implementation details:
  - Updated video-editor-context.tsx to use createContext from use-context-selector
  - Expanded VideoEditorContextType to include all state, computed values, and callbacks
  - Built and memoized contextValue in VideoEditor with all necessary state
  - Refactored VideoPlayerPanel to have zero props, uses only useContextSelector
  - Refactored ClipTimeline to have zero props, uses only useContextSelector
  - Refactored ClipItem to compute isSelected/isCurrentClip via selectors, keeps minimal props (clip, isFirstItem, isLastItem, timecode, nextLevenshtein, callback props)
  - Refactored ClipSectionItem to use selectors for dispatch and state, keeps minimal props (section, isFirstItem, isLastItem, callback props)
- Key decisions:
  - Modal state (isExportModalOpen, isAddVideoModalOpen) stays as local useState but passes through context
  - Section management callbacks (onEditSection, onAddSectionBefore, onAddSectionAfter) added to context
  - ClipItem and ClipSectionItem keep some props for callbacks that are created inline in parent component
  - Conservative approach: minimal component restructuring, no Container/Presentation split
- Files changed:
  - app/features/video-editor/video-editor-context.tsx (expanded context type, switched to use-context-selector)
  - app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx (built memoized contextValue, removed prop passing)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/video-player-panel.tsx (zero props, uses selectors)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/clip-timeline.tsx (zero props, uses selectors)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/clip-item.tsx (reduced props, uses selectors for state)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/clip-section-item.tsx (reduced props, uses selectors for state)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
- Next steps:
  - Monitor re-render performance with React DevTools Profiler to verify improvements
  - Consider further optimizations if needed


## Issue #73 - Error Page Copy to Clipboard
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality to error boundary
- Implementation details:
  - Added useState hook for isCopied state tracking
  - Imported CopyIcon and CheckIcon from lucide-react
  - Created copyErrorToClipboard function using navigator.clipboard.writeText()
  - Added "Copy error" button with visual feedback (shows "Copied" with check icon for 2 seconds)
  - Error details include: status code, title, description, and stack trace (if available)
- Key decisions:
  - Followed existing clipboard pattern from use-clipboard-operations.ts
  - Placed copy button first in footer for easy access
  - Uses 2-second timeout for copy confirmation (consistent with existing patterns)
  - Only includes stack trace in copied text if it's available (dev mode)
- Files changed:
  - app/root.tsx (added copy functionality to ErrorBoundary component)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
