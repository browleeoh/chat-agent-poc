## Issue #98: Add brainstorming mode to article writer

**Task completed**: Added brainstorming mode to the write article page

**Key decisions**:
- Brainstorming mode follows the same pattern as interview mode but with different prompting
- Uses LightbulbIcon for the UI representation
- Shares the same dropdown copy behavior as interview mode (copy conversation history / copy last message)
- Prompt focuses on: exploring ideas, extending/deepening thinking, making connections, challenging assumptions, and offering new angles

**Files changed**:
- app/routes/videos.$videoId.completions.ts - Added "brainstorming" to modeSchema
- app/prompts/generate-brainstorming.ts - New prompt file for brainstorming facilitator
- app/services/text-writing-agent.ts - Added brainstorming case to switch statement
- app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx - Added UI: icon import, modeToLabel entry, SelectItem, and dropdown behavior

**Blockers**: None
