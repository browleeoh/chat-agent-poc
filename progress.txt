## Issue #72 - Precommit hooks with Husky and Prettier
- Configured Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for automatic code formatting and validation
- Implementation details:
  - Created .prettierrc configuration (2 spaces, semicolons, standard settings)
  - Created .prettierignore to exclude build outputs and dependencies
  - Created .lintstagedrc to run prettier, typecheck, and tests on staged files
  - Added prettier, husky, and lint-staged to devDependencies in package.json
  - Added npm scripts: format, format:check, and prepare (for husky)
  - Created .husky/pre-commit hook to run lint-staged
  - Made pre-commit hook executable
- Pre-commit hook behavior:
  - Automatically formats all staged files with Prettier
  - Runs TypeScript type checking on staged files
  - Runs tests on staged files
  - Provides immediate feedback to LLMs and developers
- Key decisions:
  - Used standard Prettier configuration for consistency
  - Configured lint-staged to run both typecheck and tests for maximum safety
  - No CI workflow exists yet, so format:check not added to CI
  - User must run `pnpm install` to complete setup (permission issue prevents automated install)
- Files changed:
  - .prettierrc (new file)
  - .prettierignore (new file)
  - .lintstagedrc (new file)
  - .husky/pre-commit (new file)
  - package.json (added scripts and devDependencies)
  - SETUP_PRECOMMIT.md (new file with setup instructions)
- Blockers:
  - User needs to resolve pnpm permission issue and run `pnpm install`
  - User should run `npm run format` to format entire codebase before first commit



## Issue #74 - Video Editor Context Refactor with use-context-selector
- Implemented use-context-selector to eliminate prop drilling and improve performance
- Implementation details:
  - Updated video-editor-context.tsx to use createContext from use-context-selector
  - Expanded VideoEditorContextType to include all state, computed values, and callbacks
  - Built and memoized contextValue in VideoEditor with all necessary state
  - Refactored VideoPlayerPanel to have zero props, uses only useContextSelector
  - Refactored ClipTimeline to have zero props, uses only useContextSelector
  - Refactored ClipItem to compute isSelected/isCurrentClip via selectors, keeps minimal props (clip, isFirstItem, isLastItem, timecode, nextLevenshtein, callback props)
  - Refactored ClipSectionItem to use selectors for dispatch and state, keeps minimal props (section, isFirstItem, isLastItem, callback props)
- Key decisions:
  - Modal state (isExportModalOpen, isAddVideoModalOpen) stays as local useState but passes through context
  - Section management callbacks (onEditSection, onAddSectionBefore, onAddSectionAfter) added to context
  - ClipItem and ClipSectionItem keep some props for callbacks that are created inline in parent component
  - Conservative approach: minimal component restructuring, no Container/Presentation split
- Files changed:
  - app/features/video-editor/video-editor-context.tsx (expanded context type, switched to use-context-selector)
  - app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx (built memoized contextValue, removed prop passing)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/video-player-panel.tsx (zero props, uses selectors)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/clip-timeline.tsx (zero props, uses selectors)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/clip-item.tsx (reduced props, uses selectors for state)
  - app/features/video-editor/components/clip-section-item.tsx (reduced props, uses selectors for state)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
- Next steps:
  - Monitor re-render performance with React DevTools Profiler to verify improvements
  - Consider further optimizations if needed


## Issue #73 - Error Page Copy to Clipboard
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality to error boundary
- Implementation details:
  - Added useState hook for isCopied state tracking
  - Imported CopyIcon and CheckIcon from lucide-react
  - Created copyErrorToClipboard function using navigator.clipboard.writeText()
  - Added "Copy error" button with visual feedback (shows "Copied" with check icon for 2 seconds)
  - Error details include: status code, title, description, and stack trace (if available)
- Key decisions:
  - Followed existing clipboard pattern from use-clipboard-operations.ts
  - Placed copy button first in footer for easy access
  - Uses 2-second timeout for copy confirmation (consistent with existing patterns)
  - Only includes stack trace in copied text if it's available (dev mode)
- Files changed:
  - app/root.tsx (added copy functionality to ErrorBoundary component)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes


## Issue #75 - Standalone Video File Tree
### Task 1: Add STANDALONE_VIDEO_FILES_DIR environment variable and file system structure
- Added environment variable for configuring standalone video files storage location
- Implementation details:
  - Created app/services/standalone-video-files.ts with utility functions
  - getStandaloneVideoFilesBaseDir(): gets base directory from env var (defaults to ./standalone-video-files)
  - getStandaloneVideoFilePath(videoId, filename?): constructs full path to files
  - File organization structure: {BASE_DIR}/{videoId}/{filename}
- Key decisions:
  - Used services directory for utility functions (consistent with existing patterns)
  - Provided sensible default if environment variable not set
  - Files organized by video ID to prevent conflicts
- Files changed:
  - .env (added STANDALONE_VIDEO_FILES_DIR variable)
  - .env.example (created with documentation for all env vars)
  - app/services/standalone-video-files.ts (new utility module)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes

### Task 2: Implement API routes for file CRUD operations
- Created three API route files for standalone video file operations
- Implementation details:
  - api.standalone-files.create.ts: creates new files with content validation
  - api.standalone-files.update.ts: updates existing file content
  - api.standalone-files.delete.ts: deletes files from filesystem
  - All routes use Effect FileSystem API and Schema validation
  - Routes validate video exists and is standalone (lessonId === null)
  - Directory automatically created when first file is added
- Key decisions:
  - Separate route per operation (following codebase patterns)
  - Validation: 409 Conflict if file already exists on create
  - Validation: 404 Not Found if file doesn't exist on update/delete
  - Validation: 400 Bad Request if video is lesson-connected
  - Uses withDatabaseDump for state persistence
  - Comprehensive error handling with specific status codes
- Files changed:
  - app/routes/api.standalone-files.create.ts (new file)
  - app/routes/api.standalone-files.update.ts (new file)
  - app/routes/api.standalone-files.delete.ts (new file)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
- Next steps:
  - Task 3: Create loader to fetch files for standalone video write page

### Task 3: Create loader to fetch files for standalone video write page
- Modified loader in videos.$videoId.write.tsx to fetch standalone video files
- Implementation details:
  - Imports getStandaloneVideoFilePath utility
  - For standalone videos, checks if directory exists
  - If directory exists, reads all files and returns metadata
  - Files returned with same structure as lesson-connected videos (path, size, defaultEnabled)
  - defaultEnabled based on file extension matching DEFAULT_CHECKED_EXTENSIONS
  - Only includes actual files, not directories
- Key decisions:
  - Gracefully handles missing directory (returns empty files array)
  - Uses Effect FileSystem API consistent with rest of codebase
  - Follows same pattern as lesson-connected video file loading
  - File tree will automatically show standalone files in UI (no UI changes needed)
- Files changed:
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx (modified loader)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
- Next steps:
  - Task 4: Create UI component for managing standalone video files (modal, file tree interactions)

### Task 4: Create UI component for managing standalone video files
- Created complete file management UI for standalone videos
- Implementation details:
  - Created StandaloneFileManagementModal component (handles create/edit modes)
    - Single modal with mode prop ("create" or "edit")
    - Filename input (disabled in edit mode)
    - Content textarea (monospace font for code)
    - Form submission via useFetcher to create/update API routes
    - Auto-revalidates after submission to refresh file list
  - Created StandaloneFileTree component (simple flat list)
    - Displays files with filename and size
    - Edit button (opens modal with file content)
    - Delete button (opens confirmation dialog)
    - Hover effects to show/hide buttons
    - Empty state message when no files
  - Created DeleteStandaloneFileModal component
    - Confirmation dialog with destructive styling
    - Shows filename being deleted
    - Form submission via useFetcher to delete API route
  - Created api.standalone-files.read.ts route
    - Loader that reads file content from filesystem
    - Query params: videoId, filename
    - Returns plain text response
    - Validates video exists and is standalone
  - Modified videos.$videoId.write.tsx to integrate components
    - Added state for modal management (isFileModalOpen, fileModalMode, etc.)
    - Added handleAddFile, handleEditFile, handleDeleteFile handlers
    - Added "Add File" button above file tree for standalone videos
    - Renders StandaloneFileTree instead of FileTree for standalone videos
    - Renders both modals at bottom of component
    - Uses useRevalidator to refresh file list after operations
- Key decisions:
  - File tree only appears for standalone videos (isStandalone === true)
  - Files displayed in flat list (no directory nesting for MVP)
  - Edit fetches file content on-demand (not pre-loaded in loader)
  - Modal closes automatically after successful submission
  - Revalidation triggered after modal close to update file list
  - Monospace font in textarea for better code editing experience
  - Filename field disabled in edit mode (no rename support in MVP)
- Files changed:
  - app/components/standalone-file-management-modal.tsx (new component)
  - app/components/StandaloneFileTree.tsx (new component)
  - app/components/delete-standalone-file-modal.tsx (new component)
  - app/routes/api.standalone-files.read.ts (new API route)
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx (integrated all components)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
  - Code formatting passes
- Next steps:
  - Task 4 is complete
  - Issue #75 is complete - all user stories implemented


## Issue #76 - Add/Remove Standalone Video Files to Context
### Task 1: Add checkbox functionality to standalone files
- Added checkbox UI to StandaloneFileTree component (similar to FileTree)
- Implementation details:
  - Updated StandaloneFileTree to accept enabledFiles and onEnabledFilesChange props
  - Added Checkbox component import and usage
  - Added handleToggle function to manage selection state
  - Each file row now shows checkbox before filename
  - Checkbox state synced with enabledFiles Set
- Added "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons above file tree
  - Buttons only visible when files exist
  - "Select All" adds all file paths to enabledFiles
  - "Deselect All" clears all selections
- Updated videos.$videoId.write.tsx to wire up state
  - Passed enabledFiles and onEnabledFilesChange to StandaloneFileTree
  - enabledFiles state now properly initialized from defaultEnabled
- Updated acquireTextWritingContext to load standalone video files
  - Added import for getStandaloneVideoFilePath
  - Added else branch to handle standalone videos (no lesson)
  - Loads files from standalone video directory
  - Filters files based on enabledFiles parameter
  - Handles both text and image files (same as lesson files)
  - Files properly included in AI context when selected
- Key decisions:
  - Followed exact same pattern as FileTree component for consistency
  - Checkbox appears before filename (same as lesson files)
  - Select All/Deselect All buttons match UI style of "Add File" button
  - Standalone files now fully integrated into context system
- Files changed:
  - app/components/StandaloneFileTree.tsx (added checkbox functionality)
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx (added Select All/Deselect All buttons, wired up enabledFiles)
  - app/services/text-writing-agent.ts (added standalone file loading logic)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
- Next steps:
  - Task 1 is complete
  - Issue #76 is complete - standalone files now have same context functionality as lesson files


## Issue #76 (continued) - Add Select All/Deselect All buttons to lesson video files
- Added Select All and Deselect All buttons to lesson video file tree (matching standalone files)
- Implementation details:
  - Wrapped lesson video FileTree component in a container div with space-y-2
  - Added "Files" header (matching standalone files UI)
  - Added Select All button that adds all file paths to enabledFiles Set
  - Added Deselect All button that clears all selections
  - Buttons only visible when files.length > 0
  - Buttons use same styling as standalone file buttons (variant="ghost", size="sm", h-7, text-xs)
- Key decisions:
  - Kept exact same button styling and positioning as standalone files for consistency
  - Both lesson videos and standalone videos now have identical Select All/Deselect All treatment
- Files changed:
  - app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx (added Select All/Deselect All buttons to lesson video section)
- Testing:
  - All tests pass
  - TypeScript type checking passes
