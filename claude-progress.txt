## 2026-01-01: Create Version visibility based on latest version

Added `isLatestVersion` flag to loader that compares selected version ID with the first (latest) version in the list. The "Create New Version" dropdown option now only shows when viewing the latest version.

Changes:
- app/routes/_index.tsx: Added isLatestVersion calculation in loader, conditional render of Create New Version menu item
