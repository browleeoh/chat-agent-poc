## 2026-01-01: Backend rejects creating version from non-latest version

Added backend validation to prevent creating new versions from non-latest versions. This ensures data integrity even if the UI fails to hide the option.

Changes:
- app/services/db-service.ts: Added NotLatestVersionError, validation in copyVersionStructure that checks sourceVersionId is latest
- app/routes/api.repos.$repoId.create-version.ts: Handle NotLatestVersionError with 400 response

## 2026-01-01: Create Version visibility based on latest version

Added `isLatestVersion` flag to loader that compares selected version ID with the first (latest) version in the list. The "Create New Version" dropdown option now only shows when viewing the latest version.

Changes:
- app/routes/_index.tsx: Added isLatestVersion calculation in loader, conditional render of Create New Version menu item
